Linear Algebra
1. Vector:
Vector has "dimension", [1,2,3,4] is 4 dimension
2. Matrix:
Matrix has "shape". shape = row x column (n x m)
A "column vector" has shape n x 1, while a "row vector" has shape 1 x m.
3. Inner product:
If left-column(m1) == right-row(n2): inner product is possible
result-row = left-row(n1)
result-column = right column(m2)
result shape = n1 x m2
