1. To check if you have Aneconda:
$ conda --version
2. To check if it is on your path:
$ echo $PATH
3. To install a package using conda:
$ conda install <package_name>
4. To check to see if you have a package installed in conda:
$ conda list <package_name>
5. A boiler plate:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
basically says, only run this code if the file is being directly run
from the command line, as opposed to being imported as a module
6. Interactive Debugging:
if __name__ == "__main__":
  hello_world()
  a = 22
  import pdb
  pdb.set_trace()
  b = 33
  print add_em_up(3, 4, 5)
pdb.set_trace() opens up an interactive debugger just after it is
called; the code is paused right at that line. a is defined and has
the value 22. b is not defined yet.
To go to the next line we use "n".
7. Init git after creating a directory:
Just stay in the directory, and do:
ziru@<new directory> $ git init
